# 3.
# Findings:
# 1. The species `setosa` has the smallest average sepal length (4.9 cm) and width (3.32 cm), indicating it might be a more compact flower species compared to others.
# 2. The data shows minimal variability within groups, as evidenced by low standard deviations, suggesting that these measurements are reliable for classification.
# 3. No significant outliers were identified, indicating clean data quality.
